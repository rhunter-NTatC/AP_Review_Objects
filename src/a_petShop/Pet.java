/*
 * Pet
 * 
 * This is all the information for a single pet.
 * 
 * Your class will need the following things
 *    - Parameters to store the following: 
 *         the animals name, type of pet, breed, and age
 *    - 2 constructors
 *        1 sets default values
 *        1 sets variables according to the parameters
 *    - Getter and setter methods for ALL instance variables
 *        These must match the normal naming convention from
 *        last year:  ie... getHeight, getWidth, setHeight, setWidth
 *    - Override the toString method so that it returns a sentence
 *        with all the parameters.
 *        
 *        
 * Advanced.
 *    Note:  Anything you add MUST be used in the Runner_PetShop class
 *           so that we can see it works.  Put it AFTER my code.
 *    
 *    - Add other methods that will do something with the pet. 
 *        (Makes noise, increments the age)
 *    - Add parameters and methods so that we know if the pet has
 *        had its rabbies shot and it's up to date
 *    - Adjust the Runner_PetShop class (after my code) so that there's
 *        a menu.  The menu should be able to make adjustments and other
 *        useful things.
 *    - Anything else you can think off.
 *    
 *    
 * Sample Run
 *   Your toString() method may look a little
 *   different, but the generic output should be
 *   the same
 * 
 *    is a 0 year-old  .
 *   Mittens is a 4 year-old Calico cat.
 *   Butch is a 10 year-old German Shepherd dog.
 *   Tiger is a 6 year-old Chihuhua dog.
 *   Oscar is a 5 year-old Tabby cat.
 *   Butch
 *   10
