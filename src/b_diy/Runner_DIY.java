/*
 *  DIY
 *  
 *  In this package you'll be creating your own Object Class.
 *  Runner_DIY should showcase that it works as intended.
 *  
 *  First decide on you Object Class. For part a, that was the Pet class.
 *  
 *  Then, use Runner_DIY to create at lest 4 unique objects and illustrate
 *  that each method works as intended.  Just like how Runner_PetShop illustrates
 *  Pet's methods.
 *  
 *  The Object Class must contain:
 *     - A block comment explaining the purpose of the class.  What does is it supposed
 *         to hold or represent.
 *     - Minimum of 3 instance variables
 *     - 2 constructors, one that's default and 1 that's parameterized.
 *     - You need a getter and setting method for each instance variable.
 *     - you must override the toString() method
 *     
 *  The Runner_DIY Class must:
 *     - Have a minimum of 4 unique objects
 *         At least one using the default constructor and 1 using the parameterized constructor
 *     - Illustrate that each constructor and method operate accordingly.
 *     - At the end of the class it should print the toString() method for each object created.
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  Advanced Ideas: (feel free to come up with your own)
 *     - Add additional methods to the Object Class that do more complex things.
 *     - In the Runner, after illustrating that each method works, create a
 *         menu that lets the user create an additional object and/or change
 *         the value of existing objects. 
 *     - Come up with something you can Google how to do and implement 
 *         it into your code
